Last year I followed the [Bonilla](http://twitter.com/david_bonilla)-[Latorre](http://twitter.com/dani_latorre) meme and wrote a [simple post](http://pablojimeno.tumblr.com/post/15235768046/2011-raconto-2012-objetivos) recounting the positives and negatives facts of the year and setting some goals for 2012. This year I'll use this habit as an excuse to launch this new blog.

I will start with the painful part, analysing my 2012 goals:

#### Commercialize our product

We didn't do this, nonetheless I think it was a good call. We didn't have neither the time nor the resources to make it. Instead we focused on our clients projects and we postponed this. 

#### Help my Cachirulo Valley mates deliver a great event

Fail. We dismissed this idea pretty early last year due to lack of time, or interest maybe. I'm happy that we didn't do it also. Because I think we should focus on connecting people and encourage business networking and cachirulo talks, and less in big events or technical stuff.

#### Help Agile Arag√≥n group with AOS2012

Win. It was great to have the spanish agile family in Zaragoza. Although it wasn't perfect, in the end, most of the people were very happy.

#### Resume the Ruby users group

Fail again. I won't regret this too much because I will try again this year.

#### Assist to an important international event.

Win. It wasn't in a distant exotic country, but it was awesome. I met a lot of people and learned a lot at [Baruco: Barcelona Ruby Conference](http://baruco.org) Most sure I repeat this year.

#### Travel to Argentina

Fail. 10 years. No more comments.

#### Improve my french and italian

Win. I didn't study that much but I went on vacations with my girlfriend to France and Italy, and it was nice to test my self with real people. 

#### Optimize my time to enjoy of more of my family and friends

I did it much better than before but I have to keep on working on this. 

#### Play more my guitar and find a band

I did played guitar a lot, but I didn't find a band. Yesterday I talked about it with my girlfriend, because it was great to play for 6 hours on new year party.

Beside this I did a lot more, and I feel this was a very productive year. 
I'm pretty proud of my team, we worked very hard in many projects. Sad part, we almost abandoned the blog.
I traveled a lot, specially to different parts of Pirineos. 
I met a lot of people in many events, one of my favorites was [Unutopia](http://unutopia.es/)

Finally I will set some goals for this year, I'll keep it simple because I am an expert on finding new things: 

1. Create a new product and get it to market (work less in others projects)
2. Continue running and participate in at least one competition
3. Deliver a great TEDxZaragoza
4. Keep this blog healthy
5. Work with my friends [Dani Latorre](http://twitter.com/dani_latorre), [Fernando Val](http://twitter.com/aaromnido) and [Mamen Pradel](http://twitter.com/pensieve)

And the copy + paste

1. Resume Ruby users Group
2. Keep optimizing time to be happier
3. Make a rock band

Thank you for reading. I wish you enjoy working in your goals.
