I'm very happy that last wednesday the local Ruby group started again #win. It was one of my [personal goals](http://blog.pablojimeno.com/blog/2013/01/02/retrospective/) this year and I hope that we manage to keep it going. 

I gave a short talk about RSpec and how I started testing and how I do it now, well... it was supposed to be short but my Argentinian origin and lack of programming jargon in spanish made it a little longer. Here is a link to the [presentation slides](http://pablojimeno.com/talks/rspec-intro-and-how-i-test/) 

I want to thank everybody who came and specially to [FÃ©lix](http://twitter.com/lajamoneria) and his team ;) for their hospitality and the awesome dinner. I live you some pictures and invite you all to come to our next meeting to learn/share your interest in Ruby.
