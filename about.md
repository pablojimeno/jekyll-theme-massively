    Hi, my name is Pablo! I am co-founder of Spines. And I am just a curious guy trying to learn more and more each day.
</p>

I was born in a [beautiful town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipolletti) in Patagonia Argentina. Since I was a child I have been attracted to doing things with computers, programming, designing, recording music or communicating. And I've done all these things in a more or less professional way.

I studied Biology, and I still do, although as I was approaching the end of the degree I decided to quit and dedicate myself to this new world of the Internet. I've lived in Zaragoza, Spain since 2003, and worked as web developer and set up various companies.
In 2014 I cofounded [Spines](http://spines.me), my greatest product adventure to date.
